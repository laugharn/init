## Configuration Rules

You **MUST** follow these:

- Use pnpm
- Use next.js 15 with canary features enabled like ppr and useCache
- Use tailwind 4
- Use exact and up-to-date dependency versions
- Do not use shadcn

## Generation Rules

You **MUST** follow these:

- Do not generate example pages, routes, or components
- Use components/component-name/(client|index).tsx based on if a component uses "use client" or not
- Use lib/lib-name/(client|index|server).ts based on if the file is for clients, servers, or both
- Alphabetically sort when possible. Including function names, props, and imports. Sort imports by multiple imports first, follow by single imports

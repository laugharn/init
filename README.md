## init ü§ù create-next-app

init is a companion to Vercel's create-next-app that allows me to get started with a new project setup to my particular demands/obessions, like alphabetization.

## Up and running

To start using init, simply run `pnpx create-next-app <project-directory> -e https://github.com/laugharn/init` and create-next-app handles the provisioning. Then you can use `pnpm -C sites/main run dev` to get a site going at https://localhost:3000

## The why of init

- init lives on the frontier
- init organizes
- init uses TypeScript but not too much

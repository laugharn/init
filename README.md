## init ü§ù create-next-app

init is a companion to Vercel's create-next-app that allows me to get started with a new project setup to my particular demands/obessions, like alphabetization.

## Up and running

To start using init, simply run `pnpx create-next-app <project-directory> -e https://github.com/laugharn/init` and let create-next-app handle everything from there.

## The why of init

- init lives on the frontier
- init organizes
- init uses TypeScript but not too much

## Roadmap

- [ ] Branch pattern
